      <h4>My dear Bestfriend</h4>
      <p>
        Wishing you a day as special as you are, filled with love, laughter,
        and unforgettable moments! <br />
        Even if you don't consider me as your bestfriend, you are always my
        bestfriend so I pray for you to God that you will be blessed with life
        and successfull oneday. <br />
        May you get back all your lost happiness because i saw your worst time,
        as a best friend i can't kept my patient. It's not easy to forget the
        past but I can't see your pain as your friend so I used to say a lot of
        bad things for your good but I fail so forgive me as you possible. One
        day you stand beside my worst time but i'm fail to stand beside my
        bestfriend in her worst time. <br />
        I have seen many people in my life but no one likes you as much as you
        smile, so your smile is very special to me. Mentally and physically I
        always beside you. when you need me i will try to present infront of you
        always.
        <br />I still know that every day I think that you call me like before
        and tell me how your day went. If you say it yourself once, I will ask
        you everytime. I don't know if that day will ever come back but let me
        tell you that I am always with you as before.
